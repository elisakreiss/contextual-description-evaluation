3/16/2022 18:00:06,3:02 p.m.,"Yes, this applies to me.",Recent research is trying to figure out how to make images accessible.,3,1,3,3,1,"Are they plating on interesting, unique, or relevant dish-ware? How do we know they are preparing meals for a special event? Is there an event space visible in the background? Are tables set in a particular way with particular dishes, utensils, accessories, or decor? What kind of meal preparations? Stovetop or oven cooking? Chopping? Assembling? Plating?",It’s better than no description and captures a bare minimum of information about the image.,"It isn’t clear based on this description that the image is entirely relevant to the article and leaves me with more questions than it answers. Indicating that they are wearing white seems superfluous, as white is a very common uniform for kitchen staff globally. If there’s any visual information in this image that makes it relevant to the article, other than a loose food connection, it’s not clear to me.","Again, better than no image description, though it feels like when I’ve found braille in public spaces in awkward or impossible places to read it, and I know someone who doesn’t use braille put it there.",1,4,2,1,1,What is a “classic” building? Why is “roof” plural? What does a cross look like? How are the three arranged in relation to one another?,No description would be better than this.,There is wholly inadequate description of anything useful here and extra information I’d label as incorrect or poorly worded at best.,Not helpful at all.,4,5,2,2,2,What is a fret? How big is it? What shape does it have? What material is it made from? How is it being held? Does it have a resonant chamber or is it paired with an amplifier?,It sounds relevant.,Doesn’t really clarify the description in the article or complement it in terms of understanding what a guitar really is.,"If I’ve never seen or held a guitar, the article tells me how it operates, though both article and image description fail to describe what that looks like.",3,1,3,1,2,Are they using any items considered “consumer electronics”? Are they presenting about consumer electronics?,Better than no description.,It’s not clear that this image is relevant to the article.,"Again, better than no description, though leaves a lot to be desired.",2,4,2,3,3,"What kind of salads? Raw potatoes, or are they prepared in some way?Are pickles and olives in relish dishes, together or separate? What kind of pickles and olives? Peas prepared how? These all sound like sides, is there a main dish? Is this a large setting for a family meal or smaller? What kind of aesthetic might there be that could be useful in relation to the article?",Some larger context (a meal is set) and some specifics (listed food items) is nice.,"/nA is wholly unnecessary and distracting. Some clue as to how the foods in the image are prepared might be useful and relevant in terms of considering food origins, or other details in the image that may provide this information. “Salads” could be green, pasta, rice, potato, vegetable, meat or egg, etc., too vague. “Potatoes” is also way too vague and I just imagine a bowl of raw potatoes, which I hope to not find at my dinner setting. Pickles and olives I imagine on a relish tray, though who knows here?","Better than no description, still, leaves a lot to be desired.",3,5,2,3,2,What is meant by “large”? What is “the land”? Indicators of season? Time of day? Geography/location? Vegetation?,Better than nothing.,Just feels really incomplete.,Boring.,3,5,4,3,4,"“Small, cozy living room…with two large windows”? Two? Large? In a “small, cozy” space? What’s that like?",Some larger context paired with the specifics relevant to the article is great.,Perhaps just a little too much detail on the living room and not enough about the windows. I’m having a hard time reconciling the configuration in my mind.,,4,4,4,4,4,They are presumably celebrating a victory? Is someone holding a trophy? Is there a score board reflecting a win? How are they celebrating? Hugging? High fiving? Spraying each other with champagne?

","Basic snapshot example of one type of building material in a specific context, a church.","More information about size and shape, and possibly other design features, especially as it relates to the building materials used, would be nice.","The description of the cemetary is somewhat superfluous, though it does add to the complete picture/aesthetic of the image.",4,4,4,4,4,Is there any indication that at least one of these people is an interior designer? Design swatches? Blueprints? Measuring devices?,"Having conversation in an interior/home setting makes sense if I was or if I hired an interior designer, so simple description that feels relevant to the article.",Would benefit from some confirmation that these folks are discussing interior design.,Maybe the description is just fine and I’m being critical of the choice of image?,5,5,5,5,5,"Is there any indicator of relative time, like a clock or a window that is letting in daylight, dusk, or darkness?",Just enough description to draw a useful image while staying relevant to the article.,"Perhaps less wordier by replacing list of place setting items with “ formal place settings” or the like, and I’m left wondering if there are any side dishes to go with that turkey, and an adjective for the flowers might fill in seasonality or geography.",Well done.,2,1,2,1,3,"So, this is an example of a flat roof?",I appreciate the detailed description of the larger context.,"Relevance of the roof is pretty well lost here, and there’s really too much or the wrong detail emphasized here and it’s difficult to imagine.","Well intended, poor execution.",4,1,5,3,4,Are there ads or sponsorships visible in this picture?,"Decent, basic description of an image.",Not clear how this is relevant to the article.,Inadequate description or poor image choice?,3,2,4,3,4,"Other than sitting together around a conference table, how is this image illustrative of cooperation?","A decent, simple description.",Relevance is vague.,Inadequate description or poor choice of image?,3,1,1,1,2,Doing what? Is their hair relevant here?,Better than no description.,Wholly inadequate.,Almost rather see no description than this confusing one.,1,2,3,1,3,,Attempt to balance larger context with relevant details.,Way too much on the larger context—I probably could have lived without knowing that the walls were painted white and the dry erase marker is green.,"Some dudes using furniture, is that the relevance here?",3,5,5,4,4,,An interesting example where a big picture description is the useful detail.,The last sentence isn’t entirely necessary and description of visible vegetation would complement the article well.,Love it.,2,3,1,1,1,"What is the POV here, aerial or side view? Is the mountain range intended to be the focal point here?",,"More confusing than helpful, and relevance is not entirely clear.","Bad description, almost certainly. Possibly poor image choice, too.",Low vision,Always (More than 95% of the time you use computers),Voiceover on iOS,Safari/iOS,46,Female,Some confusions about the study,"Consider fewer cases, possibly too exhaustive? Could you get adequate data from perhaps half as many? It also challenged me to consider whether a description was inadequate or poorly done, or if the image was perhaps poorly chosen, an interesting observation. I.e., some description seem fine in and of themselves, though thoroughly irrelevant to article content, while others leaned in the direction of good description while missing the connection to the article, and I hope these nuances are the kind of observations that will be helpful to your research.",5:59 p.m.

Also daylight or nightime? Also what is a shallow hill or tree?

The context is important because it tells oyu how high up on the mountain you are. ,,5,3,5,2,5,Are there two groups of men?`,,"I'm confused a bit if there are three men trying ot get otthe ball, and then a second group of men where one is on the group.

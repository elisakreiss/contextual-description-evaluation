3/19/2022 18:15:28,3:32 PM Pacific,"Yes, this applies to me.",Recent research is trying to figure out how to make images accessible.,3,5,3,1,4,Where was this image/photo taken? What is the mountain range in the image? Name of the river? ,The description provided spatial reference to the locations of what is being described through a certain vantage point. There are some description of height (the hill) that gives me a sense of size.,"Listening to the description, it seems like the hill and river are the main parts to pay attention to. But based on the article intro, I feel like the mountains are the focus and should be mentioned before the hill and river. ","Not sure how well this image description fits in after the paragraph. I imagined more of an image describing the crust layers of the Earth rather than the river, hill, and mountains image. ",5,5,2,4,2,How many plates have been prepared? What time of day is it if apparent in the image? Is this is a home or in a restaurant?,The image description is short and succinct and I can imagine a simple scene of at least more than one chef and multiple plates of food.,It is a broad description that could have used more details; generic in nature.,Description is about preparing plates of food while the article is focused on the act of eating dinner. Food can be prepared well before dinner is actually held.,3,3,2,5,1,What is the impact of advertising and why is it important to have billboards near sports fields?,Sets the scene of wherre the billboards are located.,The billboards could have been better described to detail what is being advertised in the image.,,5,5,2,1,3,Is the point of this image to focus on the water source of the mountains that moves down towards the lake?,Good description of where lake gets its water from.,The mountain should be the focal point and mentioned first and the lake mentioned last. Starting with the lake made it the focus area where I built the rest of the image on.,"Not sure of how well this image goes with the intro paragraph. I found myself anticipating an image descriving different plants across the montane ecosystem, or a description of the delineation between regions of the mountains in its vegetation levels.",4,5,3,5,1,,,Describing both the body of water and land masses as large didn't give me asense of size in relation to each other. The word sandwiched could be confusing for some people who might interpret it as being completely enclosed between two items like meat and bread in an actual sandwich. ,,2,5,4,5,4,,Liked the description of the church made of brick.,,Gravestone cemetery reference not useful. ,5,5,5,5,5,,,,Description could be made clearer to the article by stating celebration after a victory or showing points of both teams or describing what the other team is doing if pictured.,5,5,4,5,4,,Sets the scene well.,No specifics about the window itself.,More description on weather outside or more context of scene indoors.,5,5,5,1,5,,Good description but not relevant to this article.,Not applicable to topic.,Not applicable to this article.,4,3,3,5,3,,Liked the distinction between the two different colored guitars.,Does not describe who is playing the guitars.,,5,4,4,5,5,,Liked that it points out different shape of roof as dome shaped and the spires.,,,5,5,3,5,2,Benefits of interior design versus regular decorating?,Mentions the furniture in the rooms being highlighted.,Description basic and did not give me a sense of the uniqueness of the furniture or combination or style/theme of the room.,For this I would expect a more lengthy description.,1,5,4,2,1,,,Does not highlight the building material or show contrast between buldings made from different materials.,,3,4,4,4,3,Where are the people in this image? How are they using the furniture?,,The word filled made me think the room was stuffed with so much furniture. Would have rather had description of the number and spatial position of furniture from left to right.,,5,1,1,4,1,,,No detail in what is presented as a typical American dinner so the concept is abstract.,The introduction paragraph is really vague and does not describe what American cuisine is that warrants an image yet.,5,5,5,5,5,,,"Maybe could have described the group of men with individual differences if any: old versus young, race, dress, expressions, etc.",Not sure how well the image does evoke cooperation. It can but maybe a different image where everyone is working towards a goal of completing a task would be better.,2,5,1,1,1,Why is this image and image description being used here? There is no mention of tableware in the image.,Good imagery.,Does not complement the paragraph information.,,3,5,1,1,1,The image description mentions the setting in an office whereas the paragraph focuses on home electronics. Why was this image selected?,Sets the scene.,It is not applicable or relevant to the article.,,5,5,1,1,1,,,Not relevant to the topic being described.,,"blind, light-perception only",Always (More than 95% of the time you use computers),JAWS,Google Chrome on a Windows 10 PC,37,Female,Some confusions about the study,I was a little confused if we were evaluating the image descriptions  and how clear the descriptions  were understood in relation to the paragraph or not. Some of the wording referred to description so I interpreted that to mean the description of the image and not the description of the topic presented.,6:15 PM Pacific

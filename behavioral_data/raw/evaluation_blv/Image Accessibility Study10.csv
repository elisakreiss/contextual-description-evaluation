3/27/2022 20:29:00,10:39 PM,"Yes, this applies to me.",Recent research is trying to figure out how to make images accessible.,3,4,2,5,2,"What are the advertisements on the billboards? Are they visible? If they are, I think it would provide context since this is an article potentially used for research.",Description was concise,What advertisements are being shown? I think it is relevant here.,n/a,2,2,3,5,3,Rivers are not mentioned in the article text. What is the context for the river?,The seasonality is given,"The focus here is the characteristics of this type of mountain, but the description really just says a mountain exists with a river.",Is there plantlife or other things visible here?,5,5,5,5,5,"None, appreciate the detail","I like all of the little details here. If you just had ""a picture of a church roof"", it would not capture the essence of the image","Nothing to add, the vivid details are appreciated.","In some contexts, a wordy description would get in the way but for a site like Wikipedia, the extra info is much appreciated.",3,1,2,5,2,Is there an actual window in this image? It seems to not at all be connected to the article but I'd assume there is one,not much,I have no idea why this image is here. The image text should complement the article if visually it also complements it.,Are we showing this because of the light coming in from a window? Confused.,1,4,1,5,1,"What is the interior design of this dining room? Any relevant details are not included here, I only know we have a random dining room.",not much,"The whole point of this article is to discuss design and designers, but the image does not at all convey this in the alt text.","Many more details would be needed to make this image effective, assuming they are included visually. This image alt text seems like it may be auto-generated. I don't believe many image handlers observe context currently when auto describing photos.",3,4,2,5,2,"What is on the plates of food? Perhaps not super relevant, but I'd like to know, to perhaps establish what is considered a dinner in this photo.",Description is concise,Would like to know more about both the type of food and perhaps the quantity.,"Is each plate the same, or are there different items on each plate? Does the picture show an example of several dinners or a single dinner served to multiple people?",3,4,3,5,2,How deep is the river?,Image description is concise.,"TO me, this is a very generic description, and I may have more questions, but without knowing details I'm unsure as to what to ask to learn more.","This one is challenging. Since the article is about generic bodies of water, I'm not as sure how relevant a detailed description of the river needs to be. That being said, it would be good to provide a bit more info.",3,3,1,5,1,"I want to know about the atual materials used in the image. Compare this to the roof example which gave quite a bit of details, and this one leaves me longing for more.",Not much,"The image description is generic and does not give me anything the text did not. Also, the alt tag starts with ""the image shows"" which is extraneous text.",This was perhaps the example which has done the least to elevate the text thus far.,1,2,1,5,1,"What types of dishes are included? One would assume not cups based on the text, but I don't know much else.","Not much, very generic","I want to know more about the dishes, especially since examples from different cultures were included in the text. Does the image reference a particular part of the world or style of tableware?",A very generic image that added 0 to this article.,3,4,2,5,3,What sport are they celebrating?,"For this one, simpler may be better since the article is not about any particular competition. The image is largely candy to back up the theme of the article.","Not much, since the article has a very generic title and the particulars of the people in the image are not as relevant here.",It's hard for a computer to determine how much info to provide. Perhaps this becomes a slider for users to control at some point.,3,4,2,5,3,What types of guitars are these? Are brand names shown? Are both 6 strings? I assume one is acoustic and one is electric from the description.,"For text that seems to be autogenerated, I've seen worse.","nothing really, other than wanting more details.","As a generic description, this was not bad, though I am left wanting to know a bit more about the guitars.",5,5,5,5,5,"No additional questions, appreciate the context",I like how the cross is explained in context with the other items included in the image.,"Nothing, appreciate the details.",Definitely seems like this one was written by a human.,2,1,1,5,1,I assume we have these two people because they are showing different hairstyles? That or it's a really out-of-place image.,nothing,The title is about hair. The image says nothing about hair or their style.,"This one seems out of place, and the image description actually adds more confusion than helping at all.",4,5,3,3,3,"Are there 4 people total, or are there additional people in the picture? The description is a bit ambiguous.",I like how the description explains an example of cooperation and gives enough detail for context.,"infront should be two words. Also, if there are just 4 people, it seems like there is a bit of extraneous text at the beginning.","Context like this is appreciated, especially when I want to decide whether a particular image would be suitable for use in a project.",3,4,3,5,3,"This topic in general is one I""m not familiar with, so it would take me a bit longer to process the image and text. But the two on the surface seem to go together.","Just enough detail, assuming the photo is an example of the topic.","not much here, but is there any deformity shown in the image?","A complex topic, but one that seems to be advanced somewhat by the included image.",5,4,5,5,4,Is there any additional furniture in the picture? What material is the table made of?,"APpreciate the details here, including those that do not directly relate to furniture but are important in context.","nothing, appreciate the details","Interesting that even with a description like this one, it still leaves me with more questions. The more I know, the more I want to know on top of that.",1,2,1,4,1,"I have lots of questions, mostly relating to the actual sculpture or sculptures  that I assume is in this picture but is not described.","Not much, this leaves me confused.",There are lots of inferences here. What makes this a nice day? And where are the sculptures?,"Definitely AI-generated, and not very useful. But if the discussion was not about sculptures, and this was just a stock photo used on a shopping site for instance, maybe that AI text works.",4,3,4,3,4,"Are there other consumer electronics in this picture? If not, interesting the image only shows laptops when many examples are given in text.",Like the details including number of people and where they are.,"Some parts of this are a bit wordy. If this is AI, I'd except this over the alternatives as it does give a lot of info. But there are parts that repeat text where a pronoun could be used, and an extra word ""a two board room tables""","Appreciate the details, even if wordy.",4,5,4,5,4,"No additional questions, even though it's a short image","This is a shorter ddescription but I believe it captures the essence of the photo, unless there is additional food not described.","No, one of the most concise ones I read.","Definitely seems like it was written by a human, based on the conjunctions used. Would be good to try to get AI to replicate that.","blind, light perception only",Always (More than 95% of the time you use computers),NVDA,Windows 10 with Chrome,41,male,Study was clear,"Interesting to compare lavish descriptions with really short ones. It really depends on the context. Since we are using Wikipedia here, more enhanced descriptions would be useful as compared with other websites.",11:28 PM

Are there any defining features of the surrounding environment?
Are there any standout features of the church?","“Small church,” is useful information.",The use of “relatively” and “On the ground” don’t make any sense without additional context. These terms in this particular description sounds like machine learning trying to pad the description with extra words. The lack of context for the image in reference to the article creates additional confusion.,"Using words such as “The image shows,” seems a bit redundant. Overall, the description is too verbose without providing enough useful information.",4,2,2,3,3,"What climate features are in the surrounding environment to determine the season?
Does the path of the river follow the incline of the mountains?
Is there additional visual information available about the mountains?","Relative size information for the river 
The use of “Running,” would seem to indicate that the river is moving
The use of “Mountains,” indicates to me that a mountain range or a group of elevation changes is visible in the image.","The use of seasonal terminology without additional context is confusing.
There doesn’t seem to be enough information given about the mountains.

Is there any visual indicator regarding the perspective of how the  image is being viewed, e.g from above?","“Interior view of a dining room,” allows me to visualize  a particular space which gives me some context for the article.",The lack of description specifics for the image means that I have to fill in quite a bit of information based on any relevant experience of the environment which may not be correct.,I would like to have more information on any design elements as part of this image description.,5,2,5,5,5,Is there any visual information to indicate the materials in the roof construction?,I really like the multiple aspect of the description which allows me to focus on the image as a whole with the added ability to narrow down to parts of the image. ,"The use of “tiled floor,” and “some type,” to describe the windows adds confusion and extra verbiage to the image description.","Although the title and content of the article focuses on the roof, I like that the image description includes more specifics about the church as a whole rather than just describing the roof of the building.",5,5,5,4,3,"What visual indicators exist in the image to define this body of water as a river?
Are there any descriptive elements of the land around this water body?","“Large river flowing across the land,” allows me to understand that the water is moving and that there is earth visible in the image.","“A large river flowing across the land,” seems too general and lacks the ability for the user to focus on other aspects of the image, e.g features of the land.","Although the image description is relevant to the article title and content, it lacks the ability to drill down and focus on specific objects in the image.",4,5,1,1,1,What are the hair styles of the men on the field?,I like knowing that the men are on a soccer field.,"The image description is very general and does not include any information on the hair styles of the men.
There isn’t any information in the description to indicate the position of the men, e.g standing, sitting, lying down, etc.
There isn’t any information to indicate why this might be a soccer field rather than any other type of location.","Aside from guessing that these men probably have hair, it’s not clear based on the description why/how the image is relevant to the article.",2,1,3,2,1,"What does the statue depict?
What are some features of the cathedral?
What are some features of the garden to indicate that it is a garden?
Does the path have directionality?

What features indicate the status of the chef an 5 cooks/food?Are there any indicators to determine what materials are being used/available to prepare the meals/food?","Spatial information including to the left, and behind the equipment are super useful pieces of information because it allows for context on perspective of the image. Information on the number of individuals in the image is also useful because specifics are important.","The description provides useful information, however it doesn’t seem particularly relevant to the title or content of the article.

Is there any information being shown on the computer screens at the table?",Spatial information including the location of computers and the screen on the wall are useful pieces of information.,"Referencing information on the screen on the wall without any indicator as to any information that might be visible on the computers seems odd.
Lack of specifics on how many people are in the group at the table leads to potentially incorrect guessing.","The overall verbiage of the description seems slightly off, especially the last sentence.",5,5,5,3,3,"How many people are sitting around the conference table?
Are there any indicators to determine whether they are working together collaboratively?","Knowing the position of the people relative to the conference table
Knowing that the people are working on laptops

Lack of information to indicate whether the group is working together collaboratively",Are we to infer that these people are working together rather than separately in the same space?,5,5,5,5,4,Is it clear whether or not whether anyone has an upper edge in keeping the ball or kicking it way?,The description captures the sentiments of the article title and content.,"There is an extra word “the” which is unclear whether this was a mistake in the generated description text.

More descriptive  information on the guitar players would be useful.",5,1,1,1,1,"Are there any sculptural elements in the image, e.g statue or specific landscaping element?","The use of positive language, e.g nice day evokes positive imagery. ","The image description lacks specifics or obvious relevance to the article title or content.
References to objects in the images including park, trees, lots of grass, and a pond without any relative location information makes the description less useful.",It's unclear how this image is relevant to the article.,5,5,5,4,2,"Is there additional visual information available on the mountains to indicate age or terrain, e.g smooth vs jagged?",The succinct description captures the essence of the article title and content.,The lack of specifics regarding the path and terrain of the land,"Although the image description captures the essence of the article, it would be nice to be able to have access to more specific details.

",5,2,5,4,5,Where are the table and erase board located in the room?,The description goes in to a lot of specifics which allows for a more broad overview of the image.,There seems to be a lack of focus on the central objects in the image to provide context to the article title and content.,"While it’s nice to have more specifics in the image description, it’s important to centralize focus around key objects that might bring additional relevance and context.",5,1,5,3,4,"Are there any defining features of the two windows?
Are the windows opened or closed?
Are there any curtains or blinds associated with the windows?",I like that the description provides an overview of the image as a whole by giving information about the room.,The lack of descriptive information for the windows makes them secondary objects rather than the central focus.,"While it’s great to have more specifics included in the description of an image, including a point of central focus earlier in the description is more useful for providing context.",Totally blind with bilateral ocular prosthetics,Always (More than 95% of the time you use computers),VoiceOver,Safari on Mac OS,40,Male,Study was clear,The use of start and end times doesn’t entirely make sense as it creates unnecessary feelings of needing to rush on open-ended questions.,11:30

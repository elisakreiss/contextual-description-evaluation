4/3/2022 15:57:58,5:13pm,"Yes, this applies to me.",Recent research is trying to figure out how to make images accessible.,3,3,3,2,3,"Notes/Questions: As a person with acquired blindness, I only support these with a score of 3 because of prior visual knowledge of a guitar. However, as a CVRT, I propose that this image description can pose issues for people with congenital blindness, especially if they are not privy to information about the instrument and its accessories  prior to reading the article. Things like a amplifier, pick, and other items may need to be better explained, especially since the image says the guitars are being played, but no description of how they are being played.","The description of the colors of the guitars are helpful. I believe that this is something that can inform the reader of ways that the instrument can be stylistically different, which provides more knowledge.","The image description mentions nothing of who is playing the guitars or how they are being played. When being paired with such an in-depth article about style of play, one would need this information in order to receive the breadth of the image and its contents.","I think that describing the amount of strings the guitar has, the positioning of the players' hands, if there is more than one player of both guitars, if the image is one picture of two people or two side-by-side images, and a description of the style of play (with pick, electronic, acoustic) are items that would be helpful in this image description.",1,1,3,1,1,Is the hill a result of the act of orogenesis? What does a river have to do with it? Does the river curl around the hill because of orogenesis? What does the act of orogenesis look like? Are mountain ranges created as soon as orogeny occurs?,"I didn't find anything helpful here. If anything, the addition of the mountains and hills confused me more because I then had to read the article a few more times to understand what was trying to be depicted in the image.","I believe including information about both the river and snow was pretty detrimental to understanding the article and image. Nothing in the article mentioned the need for climate and weather to be mentioned, especially at the top of mountain peaks, while the article never said that orogeny creates natural rivers or springs.","It would have made more sense to use this description if there was a mention of the act of orogeny in it. The optic descriptions of mountains work great for a visual understanding of what a mountain range or scenic hills look like, but if paired with orogeny information, this would be an awesome description.",4,4,4,4,4,Which cultural or geographical manifestation of dinner is being depicted? Are all preparers of dinner chefs? What time is dinner being prepared here?,"The simplicity was helpful here. I think with the definition of dinner including any meal at any time, it was ideal to keep the image description surrounded around some form of food being prepared. ","Given the focus on cultural/geographical differences in types of food and time in the article, I think not including time of day in the description or an explanation of the appearance of the chefs hurt this description a little bit. This would help us determine the kinds of foods served for dinner in certain places and even the possible location of the image given the time of day being shown.",No additional comments needed.,5,5,5,5,5,No questions for this description.,"I thought the inclusion of two of the different types of furniture (that which hold people and that which holds things) was great. The detail when speaking of the materials the items are made out of (glass, wood) also is an immaculate touch.",Nothing to add here.,"Great image description here. The only thing that would have taken it over the next level would be the inclusion of the bed, but I think the chairs does justice.",1,4,1,5,1,Do the soccer players have hair? Is their hair cut? Are they male or female?,I have nothing to share here.,"The article speaks of cultural and other influences for hairstyles and cuts, but the description mentions nothing towards that. The description never mentioned hair or grooming.","I believe that information about not just the article title, but the subjects of the photo would help this description shine.",1,5,1,1,1,Are there sculptures in the photo? Are parks sculpted? ,It was a beautiful description. Beautiful for describing a scenic movie or park scene in a greeting card.,The description was irrelevant to the article.,No comments here.,3,3,4,5,4,What kind of dishes are they? Do they include plates? Are there cups? What cultural version of tableware is being shown?,The description's simplicity helps a first-time learner understand the basic conceptualization and operationalization of some tableware.,"With the article being so descriptive of cultural differences in tableware and setting a table, the description dropped the ball in the details department, robbing the reader of the opportunity to better understand the content.",An inclusion of which tableware was present would be helpful to provide more information to the reader.,2,2,2,2,2,Are these desktop computers or notebooks? What device is on the wall? Are any of these in black boxes? Where are the white goods?,"The description included people and computers, which is ONE black good. ","The description did not explain what the screen on the wall is (computer monitor, television, etc.). The image or description makes no mention of white goods or ""The goods that are formerly white,"" in its description.","Inclusion of which goods are depicted is not enough. A better description of the items and how they are being used would also give help to a reader determining what tasks are being performed, which could help determine if it is a black good or white good.",4,4,5,5,4,No questions here.,I think the simplicity here was great. ,Nothing particularly bad observed here.,This was a great description. Captured cooperation perfectly without giving too much information.,5,4,4,4,4,What is a spire? How does it relate to the roof?,The description's simplicity and inclusion of the article topic is super helpful and a benefit for the reader.,"People that are congenitally blind may have trouble conceptualizing the shape of a dome and understanding what a spire is. As the article mentions accessories for the roof but doesn't expain or enumerate them, it may be helpful to flesh that out a bit.",Great description here. ,2,1,2,1,1,What is a cathedral? What is gothic? Why is the scene gothic? Is there a cross? Where is the cross located? Is someone on the cross? Is Jesus in this photo?,I have nothing to share here.,No mention of a Christian cross here. No mention of Jesus. No mention of if a body is on the cross.,"Everyone may not be Christian, thus a person with blindness who practices another religion, is agnostic, or doesn't practice faith would be completely lost by the image description. Furthermore, a Christian person with blindness (me) will also be confused because the article mentions nothing of a cathedral, thus only people who have worshipped there or are familiar with Catholicism may get confused as well. ",2,4,1,1,2,Which of this is considered a montane ecosystem? How has the body of water varied from non-montane ecosystem aquatic services? Are there any indemic species depicted??,It included mountains in the description.,"Nothing was mentioned that included pertinent information about montane ecosystems, including: changes in forests, lakes, endemic species, grasslands and the creation of tundra.",Nothing to add here.,2,2,1,2,1,Where are the building materials? ,I have nothing to add here.,There was NO building materials mentioned in the description. There was no reason to focus on the graveyard.,Explaining the material makeup of the graveyard and the fence/building would be able to make this image description begin to be a benefit for a screen reader user. ,4,4,2,5,4,"What cultural influence (African-American, Asian, Native American, etc.) does this picture of American cuisine depict?",The depth of which the food items are explained was beneficial.,"Given the contents of the article and how it described American cuisine, the picture chosen and its description did not depict it. Instead, it depicted a common Mediterranean meal (mostly vegetables and ground foods), which could distort the person with blindness/low vision's understanding of the article.",Perhaps adding a way to depict a diverse array of dishes that is more descriptive of the article could fix the aforementioned issues.,1,5,1,1,1,Where is the window? ,There is nothing to add here.,There is no mention of a window here. ,"Including a window is important. Also, including other article information of relevance (locking mechanisms, opening/closing, usefulness for weather) enhances comprehension.",2,2,1,1,1,Who is designing? How is the room prepared? Is it aesthetically pleasing? Who is enjoying the design? How is the design being depicted?,Including furniture in the description was good.,The furniture's inclusion did not come with a description of how it was arranged. No mention of the designer is made. No mention of who the client(s) are is explained. No description of the stylistic attempt is made.,No additional comments.,4,4,4,5,4,Who is competing? What are the teams competing for? What is being done to show competition?,"Using a sports reference to depict competition was great. Using soccer was great because it is an internationally recognized and followed sport, making it multiculturally applicable when trying to introduce a new concept to a person with blindness/low vision.","Though the description is good, without a prize to depict what is being competed for there is really just a picture of people having a fund, laisez-faire game. This description sounds more like an image description for soccer than competition. Perhaps adding the game in a stadium or for a trophy would help this.",Nothing else to add.,3,2,2,2,1,What are the advertisements of? Are they open-ended? What medium are they in? ,They included advertisements in the photo.,"The description depicted none of the most popular forms of ads (television, radio, social media, blogs, newspapers, etc.). Instead, it glanced by mentioning it while focusing the image description on the people and the sports event.","Perhaps describing the ad, the medium it is in, and some of its contents would better address these issues.",3,4,4,3,2,What kind of water body is depicted? Is it still or moving?,It included a body of water in the description.,The description didn't identify which type of water body it is. The description did not depict but one form of water body. ,"Perhaps including the term stream, river, ocean, etc. would help this issue, especially because with only one representation of the article topic in the image the reader will not have much to go off of.",I am totally blind with no light perception.,Always (More than 95% of the time you use computers),I used JAWS for this study.,I used Chrome on Windows 10.,33 years old.,Male,Study was clear,No additional feedback.,6:57pm
